    Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a
    scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.
    The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the
    triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

    The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].

    If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
    If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
    If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.

    Create a method to compare index one for Alice and Bob and return the greater index (make sure to keep count as you go),
    then compare index two and return the greater index, and compare index three and return the greater index. Finally
    create a method that prints Alice's and Bob's scores to the console and states the winner. Finally create a method to
    compare Alice and Bob's score and return the greater score.
